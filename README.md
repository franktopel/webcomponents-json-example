# webcomponents-json-example
Experimental example that demonstrates how an autonomous custom element can be updated by JSON. I just wanted to write my first custom element and investigate how JSON can be used to initialize and update a webcomponent.

The example is deliberately kept very minimalistic and consists of only two files. There is no build stack and no special tooling necessary to see the example. Checkout the src folder and just open the index.html in the browser. 

Not all browsers support all necessary specifications, so I recommend to use Google Chrome.

The example creates an autonomous custom element and uses a ShadowDOM.
